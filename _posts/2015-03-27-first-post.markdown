####I am Danniel Condez.
And this blog is about me, christianity  and technology. 

##Christianity
I believe in Jesus, my Lord and Savior. My blog posts about christianity will be coming from personal experiences, new things God is teaching me, and also things I learn from my mentors and pastors I follow. Comments and feedbacks are very welcomed in this blog. The purpose for the Christian posts in this blog is to grow and learn in a bigger online social community.

`Worship Ministry` has always had a home in my heart. Music is a language I love to speak. It is a space where I feel the most freedom to express my self. And in worship, I feel alive in the presence of my God. 

`Youth Ministry` is a challenge. But it is a beautiful one. To deal with younger people and leading them by setting an example was never easy. Leadership has been a weakness of mine, but I thank God for guiding me toward being a leader. Life is to live it with people you love. To share joy and pain, struggless and successes, to help people who are down, and being able to ask for help in time of weakness.

##Technology
`Front-End development` is one of my professional passions. I love to build user interfaces to help users be more efficient in what they do. Enterprise tools is my specialization, and I seek to grow and mature in making better experiences. Out of my love for my users, I find ways to be more efficient in my work so that I can deliver `not only their needs, but also wants`. This also gives me ample time to work on aesthetics and make the tools look like apple to one's eyes.

`Innovation` is also one of my growing passions. I have an enormous dream, and innovation will be the main engine how I will get there. Innovation needs strategy, a fearless heart, and enduring persistence and diligence. My journey to innovation just began but I thank God for leading me toward this exciting direction.
